  ANCIR’s investigation exposes the ‘lie’ created by the pharmaceutical industry’s insistence that the costs and patents for the development of new drugs remain confidential. Our investigation will show how artificial costing is the ‘capitalisation’ of costs: that investment is valued at the expected return investors may forego during development, contrasted to financial securities or other equity portfolios.
